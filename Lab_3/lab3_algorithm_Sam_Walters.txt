Make Change Game
----------------
01. read for amount customer owes for purchase, convert to float
02. read for amount customer paid, convert to float
03. calculate the change, rounded to 2 decimal places, and display
04. display dollars back (see algorithm below)
05. display quarters back (see algorithm below)
06. display dimes back (see algorithm below)
07. display nickels back (see algorithm below)
08. display pennies back (see algorithm below)

Displaying dollars back
----------------
01. calculate remainder for change divided by whole dollar denomination, rounded to 2 decimal places
02. calculate difference between change and dollar remainder, then divide by whole dollar denomination,
    rounded to 2 decimal places
03. if difference is greater than 0,
03a.    if the difference is greater than 1 display dollars owed back as int with plural label
03b.    otherwise display dollars owed back as int with singular label

Displaying quarters back
----------------
01. calculate remainder for dollar remainder divided by quarter denomination, rounded to 2 decimal places
02. calculate difference between dollar remainder and quarter remainder, then divide by quarter denomination,
        rounded to 2 decimal places
03. if difference is greater than 0,
03a.    if the difference is greater than 1 display quarters owed back as int with plural label
03b.    otherwise display quarters owed back as int with singular label

Displaying dimes back
----------------
01. calculate remainder for quarter remainder divided by dime denomination, rounded to 2 decimal places
02. calculate difference between quarter remainder and dime remainder, then divide by dime denomination,
        rounded to 2 decimal places
03. if difference is greater than 0,
03a.    if the difference is greater than 1 display dimes owed back as int with plural label
03b.    otherwise display dimes owed back as int with singular label

Displaying nickels back
----------------
01. calculate remainder for dime remainder divided by nickel denomination, rounded to 2 decimal places
02. calculate difference between dime remainder and nickel remainder, then divide by nickel denomination,
        rounded to 2 decimal places
03. if difference is greater than 0,
03a.    if the difference is greater than 1 display nickels owed back as int with plural label
03b.    otherwise display nickels owed back as int with singular label

Displaying pennies back
----------------
01. calculate remainder for dime remainder divided by penny denomination, rounded to 2 decimal places
02. calculate difference between dime remainder and penny remainder, then divide by penny denomination,
        rounded to 2 decimal places
03. if difference is greater than 0,
03a.    if the difference is greater than 1 display pennies owed back as int with plural label
03b.    otherwise display pennies owed back as int with singular label
